TemporaTasks is a simple, minimalistic, open-source task manager, build for swift & efficient task management in Windows 10. Crafted with a commitment to user-friendly navigation and optimized for keyboard accessibility, this project originated from a personal need for a highly efficient open-source task manager on the Windows 10 platform.
